# MyPortfolio

## Description

I built this portfolio page for myself and future employers to recognize the development of my coding skills after 1 week vs 12 weeks. Although not perfect, it is a building block none the less. CSS has been the hardest part for me. I will have to get better with that for sure. I had trouble with the images, sizing and position. I am also having trouble with the media querie and getting the page more responsive for mobile users.
